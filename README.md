# Building an Operating System

In this project, we built an operating system called JOS for an x86-based personal computer. The project is split into 6 major parts that build on each other, and culminate  in a functioning operating system on which we can run simple commands through our own shell. The 6 major parts of the operating system that we built for this course are: 
1. Booting
2. Memory management
3. User environments
4. Preemptive multitasking
5. File system, spawn, and shell
6. Network driver

The instructors provided skeleton code for pieces of the JOS, but we had to do all of the hard work. During this project, we had the design freedom to determine the details in the first few labs, and the freedom of the entire desing in the later labs. I completed each of the labs individually. 

This project was the core focus of the [Operating System Engineering Course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/overview.html) at MIT. The detailed lab descriptions can be found directly in the above link. And, much of the above/below description is taken directly from the website. 

A huge thank you to our incredible professors [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris) and [Frans Kaashoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_Kaashoek). They represent everything that is good about academia. 

## Official Course Description 
Fundamental design and implementation issues in the engineering of operating systems. Lectures based on the study of a symmetric multiprocessor version of UNIX version 6 and research papers. Topics include virtual memory; file system; threads; context switches; kernels; interrupts; system calls; interprocess communication; coordination, and interaction between software and hardware. Individual laboratory assignments accumulate in the construction of a minimal operating system (for an x86-based personal computer) that implements the basic operating system abstractions and a shell. Knowledge of programming in the C language is a prerequisite.
