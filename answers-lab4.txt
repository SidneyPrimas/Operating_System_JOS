1) The compiler and linker think that kern/mpentry.S should be run above KERNBASE. However, when we run kern/mpentry.S to setup a new application processor, the new processor can only initially acccess memory below 2^16 (since the processor was designed to be backwards compatiable. Thus, we move mpentry.S into a page starting at MPENTRY_PADDR, and indicate to the new processor to run code starting from there. However, upon compile time, the compiler and linker think the code is giong to be run above KERNBASE, and assigns values of function entry points accordingly. Thus, we use MPBOOTPHYS in order to calculate the shifted function entry points so that we can run the copied code from MPENTRY_PADDR. 
2) When stacks are interrupt?
